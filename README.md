Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA on Credit Card Transactions for Fraud Detection 
## Problem Statement:
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and
consumers. Fraudulent activities cause substantial losses and impact
customer trust. This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis

that may indicate fraudulent behavior.
Students will analyze the dataset to gain insights into transaction patterns
and potential factors distinguishing fraudulent transactions from legitimate
ones.
